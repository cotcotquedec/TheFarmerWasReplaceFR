Hi! Could you please help me translate some game localization text from English to French? 

Please keep the structure of the text intact, including all keys and symbols like '@' and '='. Don't translate the keys (the part before the '='); only translate the text after the '='.

**Example:**

Input:
@button_tooltip_save = Save the game.

Output:
@button_tooltip_save = Sauvegarder la partie.

**Here is the content to translate:**
{Content}
